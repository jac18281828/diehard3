### Explanation of the Script:

1. **State Class**: Represents the state of the containers. It includes methods to check equality, hashing, and string representation to make it easier to manage states in a set.

2. **a_star_solution**: Implements a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the solution to the container problem. The function returns the sequence of operations needed to reach the target volume in any of the containers.

3. **generate_puzzle**: Iterates through possible combinations of container capacities and target volumes to find a puzzle that has a solution with exactly the minimum number of steps specified by the user.

4. **main**: The entry point of the script. It asks the user for the minimum number of steps and uses `generate_puzzle` to find a puzzle that matches the criteria. If a puzzle is found, it prints the problem statement and the solution.

### How to Use the Script:

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Input the minimum number of steps required for the solution on the command line
3. The script will generate and solve puzzles until it finds one with the exact number of steps specified.

### Example Input
```bash
$  python3 generator/bin/find_container_puzzle.py min_steps
```


The key idea is to use a priority-based search algorithm like **A\* Search** (A-star Search), which uses a heuristic to prioritize exploration of more promising states. This method can be more efficient than BFS in finding solutions with a specific number of steps, particularly when those steps are relatively long.

### A* Search Algorithm for Container Puzzle

In an A* Search, each state is associated with a cost, which is the sum of:
- **G-cost**: The actual cost to reach the current state from the initial state (in this case, the number of steps taken).
- **H-cost**: A heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal from the current state (you can use an estimate of how many more steps might be needed).

### Explanation of Improvements:

1. **Heuristic Function**: The `heuristic` function estimates how close the current state is to the target by calculating the minimum absolute difference between the volumes in the containers and the target volume. This heuristic guides the search towards states that are more likely to reach the target.

2. **Priority Queue**: The use of a priority queue (`heapq`) ensures that states with a lower total estimated cost (`G-cost + H-cost`) are explored first. This helps in converging on longer solutions more effectively by avoiding paths that are less promising.

3. **Early Termination**: If the algorithm finds a state that matches the target volume, it terminates early, which can save computation time.

4. **Flexibility**: The script still iterates through possible puzzles, but it does so more efficiently by prioritizing paths that are more likely to lead to a solution with the desired number of steps.

### Potential Extensions:
- **Dynamic Range Adjustment**: You could dynamically adjust the range of container capacities and target volumes based on observed results to more quickly converge on solutions with the desired number of steps.
- **Multiple Heuristics**: Implementing and combining multiple heuristics might further improve the efficiency of finding the desired solution.

This A* Search approach should help find puzzles with the desired minimum number of steps faster, especially for longer solutions.

### Example Input
```bash
$  python3 generator/bin/find_container_puzzle.py min_steps
```

### Example Output:
```
Found puzzle with capacities: (3, 5, 27) and target: 15
Solution takes 10 steps
```
